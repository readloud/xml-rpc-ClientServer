		<outline text="### The story">
			<outline text="When I came to Node, three years ago, I started this file, utils.js, to put all the utility routines I knew I'd need. I've been programming a long time. And there are certain things you don't want to have to rewrite. So you put them in a file and when you need a new one you just add it to that file."></outline>
			<outline text="Then in April 2017 I got tired of including that file in all my projects. Not that I was replicating code, I wasn't. It was just a little bit more work than it had to be. So I made an NPM package out of it, so I could just do this:"></outline>
			<outline text="`const utils = require (&quot;daveutils&quot;);`"></outline>
			<outline text="And include it in my package.json file, and that's that. "></outline>
			<outline text="And this is that package. "></outline>
			<outline text="Now you know the whole story! ;-)"></outline>
			<outline text="PS: I wrote about daveutils &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/08/11.html#a092250&quot;&gt;on my blog&lt;/a&gt;. "></outline>
